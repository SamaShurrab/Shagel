# Shagel - Android Application

## Project Description

"Shaghel" is an Android project I developed during my internship at the company. This application was the first task assigned by my mentor to test my ability to accurately convert and design the app's user interfaces from an XD file into Android Studio. The main goal of the project was to learn how to translate design into effective and smooth interfaces while maintaining the aesthetics of the original design.

## Skills Acquired

- **User Interface (UI) Design**: I learned how to transform XD designs into Android applications using Android Studio tools.
- **Font Customization**: I implemented a feature for resizing the font to provide a flexible user experience.
- **RecycleView Usage**: I designed and programmed the RecycleView to display data in an organized and flexible manner.
- **Dialogs**: I learned how to use Dialogs to display pop-up messages to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**: The primary development environment for the app.
- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the application.
- **XML**: Used to design and organize user interfaces.
- **RecycleView**: Used for displaying dynamic lists.
- **Dialogs**: Used to show pop-up messages in the app.

## How to Run

1. Download the code from the Git repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect an Android device or use an emulator to run the app.
